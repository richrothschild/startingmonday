  subheadline: 'Why evidence-based product development matters in executive transitions',
  summary: `
    Most executive-search tools are built on assumptions: that visibility equals opportunity, 
    that timing is random, that preparation can happen late. Starting Monday is built on evidence.
    
    Every feature and decision is grounded in peer-reviewed research, industry data, and 
    first-principles thinking about executive transitions. This isn't about being academic - it's about 
    being effective.
    
    When stakes are high and timing is narrow, working from evidence beats working from instinct.
  `,
  whyResearchMatters: `
    Executive transitions are complex decision-making moments that happen infrequently for any individual.
    That scarcity means intuition and past experience are unreliable guides. Research-based design means:
    
    - Identifying which signals actually matter (vs. which just feel interesting)
    - Understanding what makes relationship momentum stick (vs. activity that stalls)
    - Building workflows that turn intention into consistent action
    - Preparing for conversations at the depth where senior hiring actually happens
    
    The research below shows what we know about how executives transition successfully, 
    how coaching actually improves outcomes, when role-shaping signals appear, 
    and why behavior consistency beats sporadic effort.

  title: 'Early Role Signals',
  subtitle: 'Why transition signals appear weeks before market convergence',
  overview: `
    Executive transitions move through predictable phases: private uncertainty, subtle positioning, 
    formal announcement, public search. Each phase has its own signals. Starting Monday uses a proprietary 
    system to separate meaningful role signals from market noise, then validates the pattern before anything 
    is surfaced. The leaders who win move during the early phases, when options are still forming and access is still warm.
  `,
  whyItMatters: `
    The difference between finding a role during weak-signal phase vs. posted-job phase is not just timing-
    it's decision quality. Early in a transition, decision-makers are still gathering context, building 
    the shortlist in their heads, and forming perceptions. That's when an executive with clear value and 
    strong prior relationships can shape how the role itself is defined.

    We disclose the evidence categories and validation standards, but not the exact weighting or trigger 
    logic. That keeps the signal useful without giving away the engine. Starting Monday is built to turn 
    noisy public information into decisive action, so leaders can move earlier with better context.
