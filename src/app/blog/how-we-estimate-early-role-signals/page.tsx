        <p>
          Every product decision at Starting Monday is grounded in one question: what is the earliest reliable signal that
          a C-suite search is forming? This post explains the evidence basis for that claim — without exposing the exact
          detection methods we use.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-4">What the claim means</h2>

        <p>
          The claim does <strong>not</strong> mean every company publishes a role 1–3 weeks after an internal decision.
          Executive hiring does not work that consistently. It means we frequently detect meaningful context before
          broad-market posting channels catch up.
        </p>

        <p>
          In practice, &ldquo;broad-market posting&rdquo; means LinkedIn and major job boards. Observable company-level
          changes often surface earlier context for executives paying attention.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-4">The timing model</h2>

        <p>
          We separate timing into three measurable intervals so we do not overstate precision:
          internal trigger to first public signal, first signal to company career page posting, and career page to
          broad-market distribution. The 1–3 week figure applies primarily to the third interval.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-4">Evidence basis</h2>

        <p>
          Our claims are grounded in regulatory disclosure timelines, HR process documentation, and industry benchmarks
          used directionally, not as precise predictions. We separate high-confidence sources from contextual support.
          Primary sources are cited in the{' '}

        </p>

        <h2 className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-4">Current limitations</h2>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
          <li>Private companies disclose less, so event dates are harder to validate.</li>
          <li>Some executive searches never become public postings.</li>
          <li>Role confidentiality, geography, and industry materially change lag timing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-4">How to use this as a candidate</h2>

        <p>
          Treat timing as probability, not certainty. The practical advantage is knowing where to focus outreach while
          most candidates are still waiting for the listing.
