        <h1 className="sr-only">CIO Job Market 2026 report</h1>

        <p>
          Standard advice still says: update your resume, tell your network, wait for recruiter calls.
          That playbook is outdated.
        </p>

        <p>
          The executives who close quickly in 2026 are the ones who know what is happening at their target companies before
          the search goes public. That requires monitoring, systems, and data.
        </p>

        <p>
          Starting Monday was built to provide that data. Since launching in April, we have scanned more than 600 career
          pages across the companies our users are watching - technology-intensive businesses across enterprise software,
          financial services, healthcare, and professional services. Here is what we found.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-4">What monitoring a career page actually means</h2>

        <p>
          Most executives think monitoring looks like this: check LinkedIn once a day and see if anything new appears.
          That is not monitoring. That is hoping.
        </p>

        <p>
          A company career page is updated days to weeks before a role appears on LinkedIn, Indeed, or in a recruiter&rsquo;s hands.
          The gap matters more than candidates realize. If you are the first person a search firm contacts, you have leverage.
          If you are the fourth, you are already behind.
        </p>

        <p>
          Monitoring means watching the career page directly. It means tracking changes in how roles are described, not just
          whether they exist. It means noticing when a company adds a new leadership section, refreshes their technology
          language, or posts a senior-level role that does not yet match anything on a job board. These are the signals that
          something is forming before the formal search begins.
        </p>

        <h2 id="market-signals" className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-4">The Q2 2026 CIO hiring picture: what the scans show</h2>

        <p>
          Across the career pages we monitored from April through early May, a few patterns emerged clearly.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-[18px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-2">1. Healthcare and financial services are the most active sectors</h3>

        <p>
          Of the companies with active CIO-level or equivalent VP Technology postings in our scans, 38% were in healthcare
          or health technology and 29% were in financial services. Enterprise software and professional services made up most
          of the remainder.
        </p>

        <p>
          Healthcare&rsquo;s activity is consistent with a broader pattern: large health systems and payors that spent the last
          three years managing pandemic-era technology debt are now investing aggressively in transformation leadership.
          The CIO role in a health system in 2026 looks meaningfully different than it did in 2022. Organizations are
          looking for executives who can run both infrastructure modernization and AI implementation simultaneously.
        </p>

        <p>
          Financial services activity is driven by two things: regulatory pressure on technology infrastructure and
          the ongoing integration of AI into core operations. Regional banks and insurance firms are hiring CIOs who
          can navigate both.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-[18px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-2">2. Roles appear on career pages 12 to 21 days before LinkedIn</h3>

        <p>
          Across the postings we tracked, the median gap between a role appearing on a company career page and the same
          role appearing in a recruiter&rsquo;s outreach on LinkedIn was 17 days. The range was wide: some roles appeared
          simultaneously, and others were live on the career page for nearly a month before reaching the broader market.
        </p>

        <p>
          Seventeen days is enough time to make a meaningful move. If you know the role exists before most candidates do,
          you can reach out through a warm channel, make contact with someone at the firm, or position yourself for a
          referral conversation before a search committee forms around a shortlist.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you find out the same day it hits LinkedIn, you are one of hundreds. The window is closed.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-[18px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-2">3. Three signals precede an executive posting more reliably than any other</h3>

        <p>
          We track company signals alongside career page data. Looking at companies where a CIO or senior technology
          leadership posting appeared, three signals showed up in the 30 to 60 days prior in a large majority of cases:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
          <li>An executive departure in an adjacent function (CFO, COO, CDO, or CTO)</li>
          <li>A private equity transaction, acquisition, or announced merger</li>
          <li>A major product launch or publicly announced digital transformation initiative</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The logic is straightforward. Leadership transitions create organizational gaps. PE transactions almost always
          involve a portfolio review of the technology function. Announced transformation programs require someone to lead them.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you are monitoring your target companies and you see any of these signals, the probability that a technology
          leadership role will open in the next 60 days is meaningfully higher than baseline. That is when to make contact,
          not after the posting appears.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-[18px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-2">4. Posting language has shifted toward transformation credentials</h3>

        <p>
          We analyzed the requirements sections of CIO and VP Technology postings that appeared in our scans. The language
          has changed in two visible ways compared to what was standard in 2023 and 2024.
        </p>

        <p>
          First: AI implementation experience is now explicitly called out in more than half of postings at companies with
          more than 1,000 employees. Not &ldquo;familiarity with AI&rdquo; or &ldquo;AI awareness&rdquo; - specific language around deploying AI
          tools at scale, managing AI vendor relationships, or building AI governance frameworks. Organizations are done
          with exploratory AI. They are hiring leaders who have executed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Second: the phrase &ldquo;digital transformation&rdquo; is being replaced by more specific operational language. Postings
          that would have said &ldquo;lead digital transformation initiatives&rdquo; in 2023 now say things like &ldquo;modernize the ERP
          landscape,&rdquo; &ldquo;migrate core infrastructure to cloud,&rdquo; or &ldquo;build the data platform strategy.&rdquo; Boards and CEOs
          have gotten more specific about what they want. Your positioning needs to match.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-[18px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-2">5. Wednesday is the most common career page update day</h3>

        <p>
          Of the postings we detected as newly appearing on career pages, 34% first appeared on a Wednesday. Tuesday and
          Thursday were the next most common. Monday and Friday accounted for less than 15% combined.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is a small signal, but it matters for how you structure your monitoring cadence. If you check career pages
          manually, do it Wednesday morning. If you are using an automated tool, make sure it runs midweek when the volume
          of new postings is highest. A Friday-only check misses most of what appeared during the week.
        </p>

        <h2 id="monitoring-system" className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-4">How to monitor career pages without doing it manually</h2>

        <p>
          Manual monitoring does not scale. If you are watching 20 companies and checking each career page individually
          twice a week, you are spending 3 to 4 hours per week on a task that should take minutes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here is a workable system at each level of effort:
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-[18px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-2">Minimum viable: Google Alerts</h3>

        <p>
          Set a Google Alert for each target company with a search like: &ldquo;[Company Name] careers OR jobs OR hiring CIO
          OR &lsquo;technology leader&rsquo;.&rdquo; You will get noise and you will miss career page changes that do not generate news coverage,
          but it is better than nothing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Limitation: Google Alerts do not monitor career pages directly. They monitor indexed web content. Many career
          page changes never generate a Google-indexed result at all.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-[18px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-2">Better: Change-tracking tools</h3>

        <p>
          Tools like Visualping or Distill.io can watch a specific URL for changes and notify you. Point them at each
          company&rsquo;s careers page directly. When the page content changes, you get an alert.
        </p>

        <p>
          Limitation: these tools show you that something changed, not what changed or whether it is relevant to you.
          You still have to visit the page to evaluate it. With 20 companies and a 3x per week scan cadence, that is
          still significant manual time.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-[18px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-2">Full signal intelligence: purpose-built monitoring</h3>

        <p>
          The most effective approach combines career page scanning with company signal tracking: executive moves, funding
          announcements, SEC filings, and news - analyzed against your specific background and target criteria.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is what Starting Monday does. You add target companies, we scan their career pages three times per week,
          and we alert you when a role appears that matches your profile. We also track the signals that precede executive
          searches - executive departures, PE transactions, transformation announcements - and surface those in your daily
          or weekly briefing before a role is ever posted.
        </p>

        <p>
          The difference between knowing a search is forming and finding out when the job description hits LinkedIn
          is the difference between being on the list and not being on it.
        </p>

        <h2 id="actions-this-week" className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-4">What this means for your search right now</h2>

        <p>
          The CIO job market in Q2 2026 is not frozen and it is not red-hot. It is active in specific sectors and specific
          company profiles, and the executives who are winning searches are the ones who identified the right companies
          before the search started and built relationships before they were needed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Three practical things you can do this week:
        </p>

        <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-3">
          <li>
            <strong>Build a monitored target list.</strong> If you do not have 15 to 25 companies you are actively watching,
            you are leaving signal intelligence on the table. Start with companies where you have a connection or relationship
            - timing matters most where you have a way in.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Set up career page alerts for each one.</strong> Even manual monitoring with a simple system beats no
            monitoring. If you check each career page once a week, you will catch most of what appears. If you check twice
            a week, you catch nearly all of it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Track signals alongside job postings.</strong> An executive departure at a company you are watching is
            a more actionable signal than a job posting. It tells you something is changing before the organization has
            decided how to fill the gap. That is your window.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          The data from our scans makes one thing clear: the companies hiring CIOs in 2026 are not waiting for the perfect
          candidate to appear. They are moving quickly through short search processes with executives who were already in
          their network or who surfaced early in the search. If you find out about the search after it starts, you are already
          behind the candidates who have been building toward it for months.
        </p>

        <p>
          The executives who close fastest are not luckier. They are better positioned. And positioning is a function of
          who you are monitoring and how early you are moving.
        </p>
