        <p>
          At some point in a technology executive career, the choice becomes real. CTO or VP
          Engineering. One company wants you in the vision seat. Another wants you in the build seat.
          The compensation may be similar. The titles look adjacent. But the work is different enough
          that choosing wrong can cost years.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most technology leaders approach this choice by title status. The C is higher than the V,
          so CTO wins. That is the wrong frame entirely.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-4">What the titles actually mean in practice</h2>

        <p>
          The confusion starts because both titles appear in technology organizations and both involve
          technology leadership. But the work is not the same.
        </p>

        <p>
          The VP Engineering is accountable for what gets built and how well. Their domain is
          execution: the engineering team&rsquo;s structure, its velocity, its quality bar, its
          culture. A VP Engineering who is excellent has a team that ships well, retains strong
          engineers, and improves consistently. What they build is defined elsewhere; how well it gets
          built is on them.
        </p>

        <p>
          The CTO is accountable for what to build and why. Their domain is direction: the technology
          strategy, the platform decisions, the external representation of the company&rsquo;s
          technical capability. A CTO who is excellent makes architectural bets that age well, builds
          credibility with the board and market, and ensures the company is not building the wrong
          thing exceptionally well.
        </p>

        <p>
          The simplest test: are you the person the CEO calls when they want to know what to build,
          or when they want to know if it is being built correctly? The first is CTO territory. The
          second is VP Engineering territory. Both are necessary. Neither is better.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-4">How to read your own track record</h2>

        <p>
          The clearest signal is in what you have actually done and which parts made you feel most
          effective.
        </p>

        <p>
          If your best work involves building teams, developing engineering managers, creating
          processes that made a hundred engineers more productive, and delivering complex programs
          reliably at scale&mdash;you are built for the VP Engineering track. The title may
          eventually read CTO at a large organization, but the work is VP Engineering.
        </p>

        <p>
          If your best work involves setting a technical direction that proved correct over five
          years, representing your company&rsquo;s architecture to investors who then believed in the
          platform, or making build-versus-buy decisions that shaped what the company became&mdash;you
          are built for the external CTO track.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most technology executives have experience in both. The signal is not what you can do. It
          is what you find meaningful. An excellent VP Engineering who takes a CTO role often spends
          two years uncomfortable with the ambiguity of strategy work. An excellent CTO who takes a
          VP Engineering role often finds the process management work a drain on energy that should
          go to thinking. The discomfort is data.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-4">What the career path implications look like</h2>

        <p>
          Choosing VP Engineering at a well-engineered technology company is often the path to
          becoming a broadly respected engineering leader with a specific and defensible identity. The
          VP Engineering at Stripe or Cloudflare carries as much market credibility as many CTOs
          elsewhere, and the peer group will make you better.
        </p>

        <p>
          Choosing CTO at a growth-stage company&mdash;particularly as the first CTO hire after a
          Series B&mdash;is the path to maximum ownership and maximum scope ambiguity. You will be
          everything at once for the first year and have to build the function you want to lead. The
          upside is that you define the role in a way that VP Engineering tracks rarely allow.
        </p>

        <p>
          The career mistake most technology executives make is optimizing for title rather than fit.
          A CTO role at a company that actually needs a VP Engineering produces two outcomes reliably:
          an executive who is frustrated, and a company that did not get what it needed. Neither is
          served by the mismatch.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-4">How this shapes your target company list</h2>

        <p>
          Once you have clarity on which seat fits, the target company list changes significantly.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the VP Engineering track: target technology-native companies where engineering
          excellence is a genuine competitive advantage. Companies with strong engineering blogs,
          meaningful open-source contributions, and engineering leaders who speak publicly at
          technical conferences. The peer group matters as much as the mandate.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the CTO track: target companies where the technology decision is genuinely
          strategic&mdash;where the CEO is looking for a co-pilot, not an operator. This includes
          growth-stage companies after a Series B, PE-backed software companies with transformation
          mandates, and enterprises where the technology bet will determine the outcome for years.
        </p>

        <p>
          The list you build is the search you run. Build it against the role you actually want, not
          the title you are reaching for.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-4">The clarity that changes everything</h2>

        <p>
          The executives who thrive&mdash;both VPs Engineering and CTOs&mdash;are the ones who know
          which seat they are in and why. They stop applying to roles that are wrong for them, which
          creates focus. They stop explaining themselves to companies that need something different,
          which creates credibility.
        </p>

        <p>
          The question is not which title is better. It is which work makes you excellent. That answer
          is already in your history. Read it honestly.
