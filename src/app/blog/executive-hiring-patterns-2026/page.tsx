      <div className="space-y-6 text-[15px] text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">

        <p>
          We reviewed more than 300 executive and VP-level hiring profiles across enterprise sectors to answer a practical question:
          what gets senior candidates into real conversations, and what gets filtered out quietly.
        </p>

        <p>
          The pattern is consistent. Most candidates lead with tenure, title progression, and functional scope. Hiring teams screen for
          something different: transformation evidence, cross-functional influence, and measurable business outcomes.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-4">The five signals hiring teams prioritize</h2>

        <h3 className="text-[18px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-2">1. Transformation over stewardship</h3>

        <p>
          Language like "scaled," "rebuilt," "integrated," and "turned around" appears far more often in roles that move to final rounds
          than language like "managed" or "oversaw." Leadership teams want operators who can move a system, not just maintain one.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-[18px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-2">2. Cross-functional range, not silo depth</h3>

        <p>
          C-suite and VP hiring increasingly rewards leaders who can work across product, finance, operations, security, and go-to-market.
          Narrow excellence still matters, but broad influence is now part of the screen.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-[18px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-2">3. Outcomes in business terms</h3>

        <p>
          Team size and budget ownership matter less than evidence of impact. Revenue expansion, margin improvement, cycle-time reduction,
          risk reduction, and post-acquisition integration outcomes carry more weight than activity metrics.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-[18px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-2">4. Decision quality under uncertainty</h3>

        <p>
          Senior hiring panels ask versions of the same question: can this person make high-stakes calls in ambiguous conditions and keep
          the organization aligned while doing it.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-[18px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-2">5. Board and executive stakeholder fluency</h3>

        <p>
          Strong candidates show they can translate technical or functional complexity into strategic tradeoffs for CEOs, boards,
          investors, and peers. Communication quality at that level is a differentiator.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-4">Where senior candidates still lose ground</h2>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
          <li>Positioning that sounds interchangeable with ten other candidates</li>
          <li>Experience statements with no measurable outcome attached</li>
          <li>Role narratives that stay functional instead of enterprise-level</li>
          <li>Outreach messages that ask for time before establishing relevance</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          None of these are capability issues. They are framing and evidence issues. That is fixable if you catch it early.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-4">How to apply this in your next 7 days</h2>

        <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-2">
          <li>Rewrite your top headline around business impact, not role tenure.</li>
          <li>Add one quantified outcome to each major role in your profile and resume.</li>
          <li>Prepare a two-minute narrative linking your background to enterprise-level decisions.</li>
          <li>Use role-specific outreach framing for each target, not one universal message.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          If your current profile is generic, do not add more text. Tighten the signal. Senior searches reward clarity and relevance,
          not volume.
        </p>
