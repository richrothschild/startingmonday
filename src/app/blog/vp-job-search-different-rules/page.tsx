        <p>
          Most job search advice is built around a transparent market. Roles are posted.
          You apply. Someone reviews your resume and decides whether to call you. The process
          is visible, sequential, and roughly meritocratic. Learn to write a better resume,
          prepare better for interviews, and network more actively, and you will do better.
          That model is accurate for most of the job market.
        </p>

        <p>
          It stops being accurate somewhere around the VP level. Not gradually, and not at
          every company simultaneously - but at some point in your career, the playbook you
          have been running stops producing the results it used to. You apply and hear nothing.
          You find out about roles after they were filled. You make it to the first interview
          and get a polite pass with no useful feedback. The process feels broken. It is not
          broken. The rules changed and nobody told you.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-4">Rule one: the role was filled before it was posted</h2>

        <p>
          At the VP and C-suite level, most roles are not filled through the application process.
          They are filled through retained search firms, board relationships, and professional
          networks that operate entirely outside the posting system. The job appears on LinkedIn
          three to six weeks after the search firm assembled a short list. By then, the candidates
          who were already in conversations have a significant structural advantage.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is not a conspiracy. It is the natural result of how companies think about
          senior hiring. A company looking for a CFO or CIO is not trying to maximize application
          volume. They are trying to find one person who is exactly right for their specific
          situation. They pay a search firm to surface that person, often before the role is
          publicly acknowledged to exist.
        </p>

        <p>
          The practical implication: monitoring job boards for VP and above is a lagging indicator.
          The signal that matters is earlier. Executive departures at target companies. Board
          composition changes. PE acquisitions where technology transformation is central to the
          value creation thesis. Funding announcements for companies whose next constraint is
          technology leadership. These signals precede the search. Executives who are watching
          them are having conversations when the field is still open.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-4">Rule two: the preparation standard is different</h2>

        <p>
          At the manager and director level, interview preparation means knowing your own
          background well, having good answers to behavioral questions, and understanding
          the company's business at a general level. That preparation is sufficient because
          the interview is largely evaluating you.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the VP and C-suite level, the interview is evaluating whether you are a peer.
          The hiring committee is asking: does this person understand our situation the way
          a colleague who has been thinking about our business for six months would understand
          it? Do they have a view on what we need to do? Are their questions the questions
          someone who has done this before would ask, or the questions someone learning about
          us for the first time would ask?
        </p>

        <p>
          That standard requires a different depth of preparation. Understanding the company's
          technology posture relative to its competitive situation. The age and architecture of
          their core systems. The history of technology investment decisions and what those
          decisions reveal about organizational priorities. The context that makes this hire
          important right now, not just strategically but politically. Two to four hours of
          research per company, done before every first-round conversation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most executives are not doing that. They are doing forty-five minutes. The hiring
          committee does not always name exactly what they noticed, but they can name the
          outcome: they want to see this person again, or they do not. The preparation gap
          is usually the explanation.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-4">Rule three: you are managing a campaign, not an application</h2>

        <p>
          A senior executive search involves thirty to sixty target companies at various
          stages of relationship development simultaneously. Some are warm contacts where
          a conversation is active. Some are companies you have been watching and have
          not yet reached out to. Some have a specific opening you are pursuing. Most are
          in some earlier stage of monitoring.
        </p>

        <p>
          Managing that at scale requires the same kind of discipline that a business
          development campaign requires. A pipeline with stages. Follow-up tracking. Notes
          from every conversation. A daily system that keeps you moving even on days when
          the motivation is low and the process feels stalled.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most executives manage a senior search the way they managed their first job search:
          in their head, supplemented by a spreadsheet they update inconsistently. The result
          is that opportunities fall through because a follow-up was missed. Conversations
          go cold because the timing of a re-engagement was not tracked. Companies that were
          showing signals go unnoticed because nobody was watching.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-4">Rule four: the timeline is longer than you expect</h2>

        <p>
          A well-run senior executive search takes six to nine months from the time the
          executive begins actively building a pipeline to the time an offer is accepted.
          A poorly-run one takes eighteen months or longer. The difference is not primarily
          luck or fit. It is infrastructure and discipline.
        </p>

        <p>
          The executives who land in nine months are monitoring for pre-market signals, arriving
          at first-round interviews with deep preparation, maintaining organized pipelines with
          consistent follow-ups, and managing the search with the same rigor they would apply
          to a business operation. The executives who take eighteen months are doing the
          same things, but manually and inconsistently.
        </p>

        <p>
          Every month of search timeline is a financial and psychological cost. Getting the
          infrastructure right is not a nice-to-have. It is the primary variable you can
          actually control.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-4">What to do with this</h2>

        <p>
          If you are at the VP level now, or approaching it, the time to understand these rules
          is before you need them. The executives who run the best searches are the ones who
          understood the market structure before they were in active transition.
        </p>

        <p>
          Build your target company list. Start monitoring. Know which companies are on your
          list and what signals would tell you to reach out. Have a process for building
          relationships with the retained search firms that fill the roles you want. Know
          what the preparation standard is for the first-round interview at the level you
          are targeting.
        </p>

        <p>
          None of this is complicated. All of it requires deliberate attention before the
          moment it matters. Starting Monday was built to operationalize it - monitoring,
          pipeline, prep briefs, daily briefing - for the executives who want to run the
          search the way it needs to be run. The{' '}
