        <p>
          A PE-backed CIO search and a public company CIO search are different searches that happen
          to use the same job title.
        </p>

        <p>
          The public company CIO is hired to run a function. The PE-backed CIO is hired to create a
          multiple. That distinction drives everything: what the role requires, what the compensation
          looks like, and what success means at the end of it.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-4">The PE thesis and why it changes everything</h2>

        <p>
          Every PE-backed company is operating against a thesis. The sponsor acquired the business at
          a specific multiple with a specific value creation plan and a specific exit timeline. Usually
          three to five years.
        </p>

        <p>
          The CIO role exists somewhere in that plan. Either technology is a constraint on the value
          creation (the systems are too fragile to support the growth the sponsor has funded), or
          technology is the value creation mechanism (the sponsor acquired the company specifically for
          its technology assets), or there is an integration or carve-out that requires a technology
          leader to execute.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before you take the first call, ask which of those three it is. The answer tells you what
          you are actually being hired to do.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-4">What the sponsor actually cares about</h2>

        <p>
          The management team will describe the role in operational terms. The sponsor cares about
          EBITDA and exit multiple. Those two things filter every technology investment decision in a
          PE-backed company.
        </p>

        <p>
          When you propose a platform migration, the question is not whether it is the right technology
          decision. The question is whether the business will be worth more because of it by the time
          the sponsor exits. If the answer is not clearly yes, the project does not get funded.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is not a flaw in PE-backed companies. It is the model. CIOs who understand this early
          make better decisions and build more credibility with the sponsor than CIOs who are surprised
          by it later.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-4">Speed and compressed timelines</h2>

        <p>
          PE-backed companies operate on compressed timelines. A technology modernization that would
          take four years at a public company needs to happen in eighteen months at a PE-backed company
          in year two of a five-year hold.
        </p>

        <p>
          That compression rewards a specific profile: CIOs who have delivered large-scale change
          quickly, who can triage ruthlessly, and who can show cost reduction and revenue enablement
          simultaneously rather than sequentially.
        </p>

        <p>
          The candidates who move fastest in PE-backed searches are the ones who can name a specific
          transformation they delivered at speed and show the business outcome in numbers the CFO
          would recognize.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-4">The integration and carve-out dimension</h2>

        <p>
          Many PE-backed CIO searches are triggered by an acquisition or a carve-out. The company just
          acquired a competitor. The sponsor just separated a business unit from a larger parent. Both
          situations create a technology leadership need that is different from a going-concern IT role.
        </p>

        <p>
          Integration CIOs need to consolidate two technology stacks under a single operating model
          without destroying the business continuity of either. Carve-out CIOs need to build a
          standalone technology function from scratch, often in ninety days or less, while keeping the
          business running on the parent company&rsquo;s systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you have done either of those, name it directly in the search process. That experience is
          rare and search firms know it.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-4">How equity works in PE-backed companies</h2>

        <p>
          Equity in a PE-backed company is not stock. It is a share of the proceeds at exit, structured
          as options or co-investment tied to the sponsor&rsquo;s exit multiple. The difference between
          a 2x and a 4x exit on the equity stake you negotiate at hire can exceed your annual cash
          compensation over the entire hold period.
        </p>

        <p>
          Value the equity based on the exit thesis, not the current business value. Ask what the
          sponsor paid, what multiple they need to return the fund, and what the exit timeline looks
          like. Then model what your stake is worth at that multiple versus a 2x outcome. The gap tells
          you what risk you are actually taking.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-4">How to position yourself</h2>

        <p>
          PE-backed companies are not looking for a technology steward. They are looking for a
          technology operator who can execute against a tight thesis on a compressed timeline.
        </p>

        <p>
          The framing that works: lead with the transformation you delivered, the timeline you delivered
          it in, and the business outcome in numbers. Then connect it explicitly to what the
          sponsor&rsquo;s thesis requires. If you cannot make that connection before the first call,
          make it before the second.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-4">What Starting Monday watches</h2>

        <p>
          Starting Monday tracks the organizational signals that precede PE-backed CIO searches: sponsor
          acquisition announcements, management team changes at portfolio companies, and technology
          leadership gaps at firms approaching a value creation inflection.
        </p>

          builds the context for each specific company: what the sponsor acquired it for, what the exit
          thesis appears to be, and what technology capability the business is missing. That context
          makes the first conversation a different kind of conversation.
