          Most outplacement programs were not designed for technology executive searches.
          They were designed for general executive transition. The resume review is the same.
          The interview coaching is the same. The job board access is the same. A CIO departing
          after a decade of enterprise transformation has a different search profile than a CFO
          leaving after a restructuring, and the tools required are different too.
        </p>

        <p>
          CHROs make outplacement vendor decisions without differentiating between executive
          categories. That is understandable. Most vendors do not differentiate either. But the
          outcome gap is measurable: technology executive searches run longer than general
          executive searches, first-round failure rates are higher, and the most common cause
          of failure is not fit. It is preparation.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-4">Why technology executive searches are different</h2>

        <p>
          A CIO or CTO interview is not a general executive interview. The hiring committee
          is evaluating something specific: does this person understand our technology situation
          at a peer level, or do they understand it at the level of someone who read our
          annual report?
        </p>

        <p>
          That distinction is audible in the first ten minutes. A candidate who knows the company's
          technology posture, the history of its architecture decisions, the competitive pressure
          shaping its next investment cycle, and the operating model the technology function will
          need to support - that candidate is a different category. Most candidates are not that
          prepared. The research required to get there takes two to four hours per company, and
          senior executives in active search are managing thirty to sixty target companies
          simultaneously.
        </p>

        <p>
          The other structural difference: CIO and CTO roles are rarely posted when the search
          begins. They surface through retained search firms, board relationships, and informal
          networks. An executive who finds out about an opportunity when it appears on LinkedIn
          is three to six weeks behind the field. The short list was assembled before the posting.
          That timing problem requires intelligence infrastructure - not a job board.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-4">What standard outplacement misses</h2>

        <p>
          Standard outplacement programs are built around three deliverables: a revised resume,
          improved interview coaching, and access to a job board. For technology executives, none
          of those three things addresses the primary failure modes.
        </p>

        <p>
          The resume is rarely the problem. Technology executives with twenty years of documented
          outcomes do not fail at the resume stage. They fail at the first round because they
          arrived at a company they did not know well enough. They fail because they did not have
          a thesis about the technology function's priorities. They fail because the questions they
          asked were the questions a job seeker would ask, not a peer.
        </p>

        <p>
          The interview coaching is not wrong - it is insufficient. General interview coaching
          does not address the technology-specific preparation that determines first-round outcomes
          for CIO and CTO candidates.
        </p>

        <p>
          The job board is structurally late. By the time a VP of Technology or CIO role appears
          on a job board, the retained search firm has been working the mandate for four to six
          weeks. The candidates who are already in conversations reached out before the posting.
          A job board does not help the executive get there first.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-4">What adequate transition support looks like</h2>

        <p>
          Technology executives in transition need four things that general outplacement does
          not provide:
        </p>

        <p>
          First, company intelligence monitoring. A platform that watches their target companies
          for signals that precede a CIO or CTO search: executive departures, board changes,
          PE acquisitions, 8-K filings, technology team signals. When the pattern surfaces, the
          executive reaches out before the mandate goes to a firm. That is the window that matters.
        </p>

        <p>
          Second, AI-generated interview prep briefs. Before every first-round interview, a full
          brief on the company: the technology situation, the win thesis the executive should lead
          with, the objections the hiring committee will raise, and the questions only a peer
          would think to ask. This takes sixty seconds to generate and replaces two hours of
          manual research. The difference in first-round performance is measurable.
        </p>

        <p>
          Third, a structured pipeline. Forty to sixty target companies, each at a different
          relationship stage, each with pending follow-ups and conversation notes. Managing this
          in a spreadsheet produces the disorganized, passive search that takes eighteen months
          instead of nine.
        </p>

        <p>
          Fourth, daily discipline. The search loses momentum between outplacement sessions.
          A daily briefing - new signals, pending follow-ups, pipeline actions - keeps the
          executive moving on days when the sessions are not scheduled.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-4">How CHROs can influence outcomes</h2>

        <p>
          The CHRO is upstream of every outplacement decision. That positioning creates leverage
          that is rarely used fully.
        </p>

        <p>
          The simplest intervention: when a technology executive is entering transition, specify
          that their outplacement package should include a technology-specific search platform
          alongside the general coaching program. Most outplacement vendors will accommodate
          the addition. If they cannot, Starting Monday can be included directly as part of
          the transition package - it works independently of any outplacement provider.
        </p>

        <p>
          The more substantive intervention: when evaluating outplacement vendors for technology
          executive populations, ask specifically what the vendor provides for pre-market signal
          monitoring, technology-specific interview preparation, and structured pipeline management.
          If the answer is the same program they provide for every executive category, the gap is
          what is described above.
        </p>

        <p>
          The outcome from this investment is not abstract. A technology executive who lands in
          nine months instead of fourteen months is a measurable improvement in transition cost,
          COBRA exposure, and the relationship between the departing executive and the organization.
          The executives who land well remember how the transition was handled. Those who land poorly
          remember that too.
        </p>
