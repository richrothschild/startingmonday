              <h2 className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900">What Starting Monday is</h2>
              <p>
                Starting Monday is an AI-powered job search platform built specifically for VP and
                C-suite technology executives. It gives them the intelligence infrastructure that
                senior searches require: monitoring of target companies for pre-search signals,
                AI-generated prep briefs for every interview, a structured pipeline for tracking
                relationships and conversations, and a daily briefing that keeps the search moving.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was built by Rich Rothschild, who spent two years
                studying why senior technology executive searches fail and what the executives who
                land well actually do differently. Starting Monday is the system that runs the search
                correctly.
              </p>
            </section>

            {/* Why your audience */}
            <section className="space-y-4 text-[15px] text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
              <h2 className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900">Why your audience is the right audience</h2>
              <p>
                Every senior manager, director, and VP in your audience is at most one transition
                away from the search that Starting Monday was built for. Many of them are already
                there. They are the executives who followed the standard job search playbook at the
                VP level, discovered it does not work the same way, and are trying to figure out
                what the new rules are.
              </p>
              <p>
                The content that explains those rules is genuinely useful to your audience and
                genuinely differentiating for your show or newsletter. The senior executive search
                is not well covered. Most career content stops before the VP threshold. Your
                listeners and readers who have crossed it, or are about to, have no good resources.
              </p>
              <p>
                That gap is the content opportunity. Starting Monday is the operational answer to
                the strategic question the content raises.

                Starting Monday continuously monitors hundreds of company career pages across
                technology-intensive sectors. The platform tracks executive departure signals,
                leadership team changes, funding events, PE ownership transitions, and career
                page posting patterns that precede formal senior technology and C-suite searches.
              </p>
              <p>
                That data is original and current. It is not recycled from LinkedIn or job boards.
                For newsletters that publish market intelligence, it is the kind of research that
                readers forward to colleagues and cite in their own work.
              </p>
              <p>
                Research partnerships are structured as co-branded quarterly reports. Starting
                Monday provides the analysis. You publish under your brand. Attribution notes

              <p>
                We are not looking for a sponsor read. We are not interested in a 30-second

                If the fit is right, the financial arrangement follows naturally. If the content
