    name: 'Engagement Pipeline',
    forNetwork: 'Fractional executives track prospective engagements across fifteen to twenty-five target companies at any given time. Most track them in a spreadsheet or their inbox. Follow-ups get missed. Context disappears between conversations. Starting Monday\'s pipeline gives fractional executives a structured system: every prospective engagement logged, every conversation stage tracked, every follow-up scheduled. The same pipeline infrastructure used for full-time search works for fractional engagement tracking.',
    outcome: 'Members stop losing opportunities to follow-up failures and disorganized pipelines. Their engagement business runs like a system, not a memory exercise.',
  },
  {
    name: 'Company Intelligence Scanner',
    forNetwork: 'Fractional opportunities are created by organizational events: a PE acquisition that requires technology transformation, a leadership departure that creates an interim need, a funding event that requires infrastructure scale, a merger that requires integration architecture. Starting Monday monitors every company a member is tracking for exactly these signals. When the event surfaces, the member reaches out before the staffing firm gets the call.',
    outcome: 'Members identify fractional opportunities before they are posted anywhere. They enter the conversation as a known contact, not a cold applicant.',
  },
  {
    name: 'AI Prep Briefs',
    forNetwork: 'A new client meeting is not a job interview, but the preparation requirements are identical. The executive needs to understand the company situation, the technology posture, the operating challenges the technology function is facing, and the questions that demonstrate genuine operational depth. Starting Monday generates a full prep brief in 60 seconds before any high-stakes client meeting. The brief covers everything a peer would know.',
    outcome: 'Members arrive at new client meetings having done the research that distinguishes a seasoned operator from someone who read the website. That is visible in the first conversation.',
  },
  {
    name: 'Full-Time Transition Support',
    forNetwork: 'When a fractional engagement leads to a full-time conversation, the infrastructure is already built. Every company signal tracked, every conversation logged, the company intelligence assembled over weeks or months. The member does not restart a search from scratch. They accelerate into a full-time process with a head start. Starting Monday operates in both modes simultaneously.',
    outcome: 'The move from fractional to full-time is immediate, not a reset. Members are positioned from day one of the full-time conversation rather than scrambling to prepare.',
  },
  {
    name: 'Market Intelligence',
    forNetwork: 'The daily briefing surfaces new signals across all companies a member is tracking. For fractional executives, that intelligence has two uses: identifying new engagement opportunities and monitoring current clients for escalating situations that might expand the engagement scope. A signal on a current client\'s competitor can become the context for an expanded mandate.',
    outcome: 'Members stay ahead of the market they are working in. Their advice to clients is grounded in current market intelligence, not just the client\'s internal view.',

              <h2 className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900">What Starting Monday is</h2>
              <p>
                Starting Monday is an AI-powered platform built for VP and C-suite technology executives.
                It gives them the infrastructure that senior searches require: monitoring of target companies
                for pre-search signals, AI-generated prep briefs, a structured engagement and relationship
                pipeline, and a daily briefing that keeps the search moving.
              </p>
              <p>
                For fractional CIO and CTO networks, the platform serves a dual function: it supports the
                ongoing fractional engagement business and supports the eventual full-time search when the
                time is right. Members use one platform for both modes.
              </p>
            </section>

            {/* The gap */}
            <section className="space-y-4 text-[15px] text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
              <h2 className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900">The gap it fills</h2>
              <p>
                A fractional CIO managing three active engagements and fifteen prospective targets is
                running a business development operation with no infrastructure. They track prospects
                in a spreadsheet, prepare for client meetings the night before, and find out about new
                fractional opportunities when a colleague mentions them or when a posting appears on
                LinkedIn.
              </p>
              <p>
                The executives on your network who do this well are the exception. Most are leaving
                engagement opportunities on the table because the pipeline is disorganized, the signal
                monitoring is manual, and the preparation is inconsistent. That is a network performance
                problem, not just an individual one.
              </p>
              <p>
                Starting Monday replaces the manual infrastructure with a platform built for exactly
                this search profile.

              <h2 className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900">What it does not do</h2>
              <p>
                Starting Monday does not replace the matchmaking, client relationships, or business
                development infrastructure that your network provides. It does not source new clients
                for your members or manage contracts and billing. It does not know the specific client
                dynamics, internal politics, or engagement terms that your members navigate.
              </p>
              <p>
                It handles the research, the tracking, and the intelligence. Your network handles the
                relationships and the placements.

              <p>
                The simplest way to start: make Starting Monday available as a member resource and
                ask a few members to use it for one month. The feedback from members who have been
                manually tracking their pipeline will be immediate.
