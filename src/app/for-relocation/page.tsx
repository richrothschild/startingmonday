    forFirm: 'An executive who just relocated to a new city does not know which companies are worth pursuing, which teams are growing, or which leadership vacancies are about to surface. Starting Monday builds a target list for the new market - monitoring companies the executive adds for executive changes, funding, career page signals, and organizational patterns that precede senior executive searches.',
    outcome: 'Executives identify the right companies in the new market faster. They are reaching out to the right people before the role is posted.',

    forFirm: 'A relocated executive is rebuilding their professional network from scratch. Starting Monday gives them a structured pipeline to track every new relationship: who they have met, what was discussed, what the follow-up is, and when. Without structure, the networking effort becomes ad hoc and stalls within weeks.',

    name: 'AI Interview Prep Briefs',
    forFirm: 'In the new market, executives are interviewing at companies they do not know well. Before every interview, Starting Monday generates a full prep brief: company situation, the technology function context, the narrative to lead with, likely objections, and the questions that demonstrate genuine preparation. It draws from everything the executive has tracked.',
    outcome: 'Executives interview at unfamiliar companies with depth preparation. They arrive as peers, not outsiders.',
  },
  {
    name: 'Daily Search Discipline',
    forFirm: 'Relocation is disruptive. The executive is settling a new home, finding schools, rebuilding a social network. The job search competes with everything else and often loses. The daily briefing from Starting Monday installs a rhythm: new signals on tracked companies, pending follow-ups, pipeline actions overdue. The search stays active through the disruption.',

  {
    name: 'Trailing Executive Career Services',
    forFirm: 'Many corporate relocations involve a dual-career couple. When one executive moves for their employer, their spouse or partner often needs to find a new role in the destination city. Starting Monday gives trailing executives the same search infrastructure: target list, pipeline, prep briefs, daily briefing. No separate enrollment process.',
    outcome: 'Your relocation program solves the dual-career problem with a concrete tool, not just a list of local recruiters. That is a meaningful differentiator for corporate clients evaluating relocation providers.',

              <h2 className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900">What Starting Monday is</h2>
              <p>
                Starting Monday is an AI-powered job search platform built for senior executives.
                It gives them the intelligence infrastructure that senior searches require: monitoring of
                target companies for pre-search signals, AI-generated prep briefs for every interview,
                a structured pipeline for tracking relationships and conversations, and a daily briefing
                that keeps the search moving.
              </p>
              <p>
                For relocation firms, the platform serves a specific function: it gives newly relocated
                executives a systematic way to enter a new market and build the relationships that lead
                to senior roles - before searches are posted and before the moment passes.
              </p>
            </section>

            {/* The gap */}
            <section className="space-y-4 text-[15px] text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
              <h2 className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900">The gap it fills</h2>
              <p>
                An executive who relocates to a new city faces a compounding problem. They are disrupted
                personally at the exact moment they need to be most effective professionally. They do not
                know the local market, the local relationships, or which companies are worth pursuing.
                They have no intelligence infrastructure to monitor the new market for signals.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most relocated executives rely on LinkedIn searches, a few cold introductions, and
                whatever local recruiters happen to reach out. That is not a campaign. That is waiting.
                At the VP and C-suite level, the window to establish yourself in a new market before
                the good opportunities are filled is shorter than most executives expect.
              </p>
              <p>
                Starting Monday replaces the manual effort with infrastructure. The executive builds
                a target list for the new market, monitors it for signals, tracks every relationship
                they are building, and prepares for every conversation.

                Starting Monday does not replace the destination services your firm provides:
                the community introductions, the local market orientation, the housing and school
                placement services. It does not know the informal reputation dynamics in a local
                market or which local executives can make a warm introduction at a target company.
              </p>
              <p>
                It handles the research, the pipeline tracking, and the daily search discipline.
                Your team handles everything else.
