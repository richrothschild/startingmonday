        <h2 id="category-mistake" className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900">The category mistake</h2>
        <p>
          Starting Monday exists because the market has been telling executives the wrong story for years: that landing the right role is mostly about better resumes, more applications, or more hustle. That is the category mistake.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the senior level, the real problem is execution under uncertainty. Roles are shaped before they are posted. Context changes between conversations. The best candidates are not the ones who move fastest after the listing appears; they are the ones who arrive already informed, already prepared, and already in motion.
        </p>
        <h2 id="what-we-built" className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-2">What we built</h2>
        <p>
          I built Starting Monday to correct that mismatch. The product is a search operating system, not a content feed. It gives executives and coaches the signal layer, preparation layer, and accountability layer that their campaigns were missing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal is not to replace coaching or relationship-building. The goal is to make both more effective by reducing the amount of time spent rebuilding context and increasing the amount of time spent making good decisions.
        </p>

        <h2 id="expected-outcomes" className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900 pt-2">Expected outcomes</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
          <li><span className="font-semibold text-slate-900">Outcome:</span> More strategic first conversations because preparation happens before the call.</li>
          <li><span className="font-semibold text-slate-900">Outcome:</span> Less between-session drift because next actions are explicit.</li>
          <li><span className="font-semibold text-slate-900">Outcome:</span> Higher coaching leverage because context recovery work is reduced.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Outcome metric: in pilot observations, campaigns with explicit daily next actions reached high-quality first conversations faster than reactive campaigns.
