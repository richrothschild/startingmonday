  title: 'Outplacement FAQ | Starting Monday',
  description: 'FAQ for outplacement and transition firms evaluating Starting Monday as an execution layer for executive cohorts.',
  alternates: { canonical: 'https://startingmonday.app/for-outplacement/faq' },
}

const FAQS = [
  {
    id: 'fit',
    category: 'Program Fit',
    question: 'Who is the best fit for this workflow?',
    answer: 'Best fit is VP and C-suite transition cohorts where speed, positioning quality, and interview readiness directly affect program outcomes. It is strongest when participants are in active or near-active search mode and willing to maintain weekly pipeline discipline.',
  },
  {
    id: 'replacement',
    category: 'Program Fit',
    question: 'Does this replace counselors, workshops, or coaching?',
    answer: 'No. It handles the operating layer between sessions: signal detection, workflow tracking, and prep generation. Your counselors remain the strategic and human layer. The intent is to increase session quality, not replace people.',
  },
  {
    id: 'activation',
    category: 'Rollout',
    question: 'How fast can a cohort go live?',
    answer: 'Most programs can launch within a week. Typical flow is kickoff alignment, seat provisioning, cohort invitation, and a brief orientation for counselors and participants. First meaningful usage usually appears in week one.',
  },
  {
    id: 'measurement',
    category: 'Measurement',
    question: 'How do we measure whether this is working?',
    answer: 'Use a 30-day scorecard: activation rate, signal-driven actions, prep brief usage before interviews, and momentum markers such as first qualified outreach or interview progression. Compare against your current cohort baseline.',
  },
  {
    id: 'privacy',
    category: 'Security & Privacy',
    question: 'How is participant data controlled?',
    answer: 'Access is permission-based and revocable. Participant-level sharing can be managed at the program level with audit visibility into activity. This allows counselor support without removing participant control.',
  },
  {
    id: 'security',
    category: 'Security & Privacy',
    question: 'What security posture should firms expect?',
    answer: 'Data is encrypted in transit and at rest, with role-based access controls and row-level protections in the data layer. We can provide additional documentation for partner due diligence conversations.',
  },
  {
    id: 'procurement-pack',
    category: 'Security & Privacy',
    question: 'What does your trust and procurement pack include?',
    answer: 'The trust pack covers data ownership model, participant permission controls, access logging and audit visibility, retention and deletion approach, and incident-response process. Most firms run security and legal review in parallel with pilot setup.',
  },
  {
    id: 'participant-lifecycle',
    category: 'Rollout',
    question: 'How do you handle participant lifecycle states such as pause, exit, or restart?',
    answer: 'Programs can manage participant status as active, paused, or exited. Access and visibility follow program permissions, and cohort reporting can segment by status so your team can distinguish adoption risk from planned inactivity.',
  },
  {
    id: 'integration',
    category: 'Rollout',
    question: 'What is manual versus automated in the pilot?',
    answer: 'The pilot is intentionally lightweight: participant setup, company targeting, and counselor workflow are designed to run without heavy integration work. Program teams can evaluate fit first, then decide whether deeper process integration is needed for scale.',
  },
  {
    id: 'sla',
    category: 'Rollout',
    question: 'What support model and response times should we expect?',
    answer: 'Support tiers are defined by impact and captured in partner commercial terms: P1 (pilot blocking) same-business-day response target, P2 (high impact with workaround) next-business-day response target, and P3 (configuration/content request) two-business-day response target. Pilot agreements can include escalation contacts and review cadence obligations.',
  },
  {
    id: 'intervention-thresholds',
    category: 'Rollout',
    question: 'What are the intervention trigger thresholds for stalled participants?',
    answer: 'Baseline trigger examples: no meaningful action for 7 days, overdue follow-up count above threshold, or prep-brief usage below expected level for active interview participants. Each trigger maps to named counselor and program-owner interventions in the runbook.',
  },
  {
    id: 'socialize-counselors',
    category: 'Rollout',
    question: 'How do we socialize this to counselors without adoption backlash?',
    answer: 'Position it as counselor leverage, not counselor replacement. First-session script: "This does not replace coaching. It removes repeatable tracking/admin work so we can spend more time on strategy and decision quality." The runbook includes rollout checklist and reinforcement prompts.',
  },
  {
    id: 'session-prep',
    category: 'Rollout',
    question: 'What exactly should counselors review before the next session?',
    answer: 'Use a three-part prep scan: what changed since last session, which participants are stalled by trigger threshold, and which high-stakes conversations need prep-brief review. The runbook includes a verbatim pre-session template.',
  },
  {
    id: 'pricing',
    category: 'Commercials',
    question: 'How does pricing work for outplacement cohorts?',
    answer: 'Programs are typically structured with seat-based pricing and centralized billing. Cohort volume and term can influence pricing bands. Start with pilot seats and scale after pass/fail review.',
  },
  {
    id: 'pilot-contract',
    category: 'Commercials',
    question: 'How is the pilot contract structured?',
    answer: 'Pilot agreements are typically scoped to one cohort, one scorecard window, and explicit pass/fail criteria. Expansion is a separate decision milestone after pilot readout, so procurement risk stays controlled.',
  },
  {
    id: 'results',
    category: 'Commercials',
    question: 'Can we use this in RFP or client outcome conversations?',
    answer: 'Yes, with appropriate claim discipline. Use your own observed cohort outcomes first, and treat shared pilot metrics as directional context unless explicitly approved as external claims.',
  },
]

const OBJECTIONS = [
  {
    objection: 'Our participants are already overloaded and will not adopt another platform.',
    response: 'Start with a small pilot cohort and set one daily action expectation. Framing matters: this is not another app, it is the operating layer that reduces uncertainty and morning decision fatigue.',
  },
  {
    objection: 'Our counselors already do this manually.',
    response: 'Manual support is valuable, but expensive at scale. The platform handles repeatable operating work so counselors can stay focused on judgment, positioning, and confidence coaching.',
  },
  {
    objection: 'Security review will slow us down.',
    response: 'Treat security review as a parallel track during pilot planning. Most teams can run legal and security diligence while the pilot workflow and scorecard are being prepared.',
  },
