              <p>
                Starting Monday is an AI-powered search platform built for VP and C-suite executives
                in active career transition. Pipeline tracking, company intelligence scanning, AI
                interview prep briefs, daily briefing, and a strategy brief built from their background
                and target list.
              </p>
              <p>
                For outplacement firms, it is the operational layer that turns your program into an
                active campaign. Your counselors provide the strategy and support. Starting Monday
                provides the infrastructure the executive needs to actually run the search.
              </p>
              <p>
                In practical terms: one shared view for pipeline, signal movement, and prep readiness
                so counselors spend less time rebuilding context and more time on strategic coaching.
              </p>

              <ul className="space-y-2 text-[15px] text-slate-200 leading-relaxed pl-1">
                <li>+ More executives taking weekly search actions instead of drifting</li>
                <li>+ Better interview readiness before high-stakes conversations</li>
                <li>+ Clear cohort-level visibility without manual check-in overhead</li>

              <h2 className="text-[22px] font-bold text-white">The gap it fills</h2>
              <p>
                Most outplacement programs are built around workshops, resume reviews, and interview
                coaching. Those are necessary. But they do not give the executive the daily operational
                infrastructure to run a modern senior search.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your executive leaves the program with a revised resume, a revised LinkedIn profile,
                and a list of best practices. Then they go home and manage their search in a
                spreadsheet - manually tracking 40 companies, missing signals before roles are posted,
                preparing for interviews the night before with a ten-minute web search.
              </p>
              <p>
                The gap between your program and a successful placement is infrastructure. Starting
                Monday fills it.
