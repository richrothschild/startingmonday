That data becomes association-branded research: quarterly reports on technology executive hiring trends, sector-by-sector signal analysis, and role demand patterns.

The moment of transition is when association support matters most.',

              <h2 className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900">What Starting Monday is</h2>
              <p>
                Starting Monday is an AI-powered search platform built for VP and C-suite technology
                executives. It gives them the intelligence infrastructure that senior searches require:
                monitoring of target companies for pre-search signals, AI-generated prep briefs for
                every interview, structured pipeline tracking, and a daily briefing that keeps the
                search moving.
              </p>
              <p>
                For C-suite and technology associations, the platform is a member benefit that
                delivers concrete value at the moment members need it most - when they are in
                transition. Most professional associations offer their members the same set of
                benefits: a directory, a network, events, and a job board. At the VP and C-suite
                level, those are necessary but not sufficient.
              </p>
              <p>
                Technology executives entering transition need more than introductions. They need an
                intelligence infrastructure that tells them which companies to watch, what signals
                precede a search, and how to show up to an interview having done the research that a
                peer would do. The executives in your membership are exactly the people Starting
                Monday was built for. When you make Starting Monday available as a member benefit,
                you give your members a tool that works - not a workshop they attend once and a job
                board they check twice.

              <p>
                Starting Monday does not replace the peer relationships, the chapter events, or
                the credentialing programs that make a technology association worth joining. It
                does not provide the introduction from a board member that opens a specific door,
                or the knowledge that comes from being in the room with peers.
              </p>
              <p>
                It handles the research, the tracking, and the daily search discipline. Your
                association handles the relationships.

                a discounted access code for your membership. Members self-activate. You track
                adoption. We share anonymized usage data.
