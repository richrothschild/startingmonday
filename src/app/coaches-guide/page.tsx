It surfaces executive departures, board changes, funding announcements, and career page postings for every company your client is tracking. When a pattern clusters into a pre-search signal, the platform names it and flags it.',

    forCoach: 'Before every coaching session where your client has an interview coming up, read their prep brief. It usually takes about a minute to generate. It covers the company situation, the likely objections, the questions only a peer would think to ask, and the narrative your client should lead with. You arrive at the session as a peer, not as someone who needs to be briefed by your client.',

            <p>
              Starting Monday is an AI-powered job search platform built for VP and C-suite executives.
              It gives them the intelligence infrastructure that senior searches require: monitoring of
              target companies for pre-search signals, AI-generated prep briefs for every interview,
              a structured pipeline for tracking relationships and conversations, and a daily briefing
              that keeps the search moving between sessions.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is not a job board. It is not a coaching tool. It is the research and infrastructure
              layer that sits underneath the strategic work you do.
            </p>
          </section>

          {/* The gap */}
          <section className="space-y-4 text-[15px] text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
            <h2 className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900">The gap it fills</h2>
            <p>
              Your clients in transition are spending the majority of their time on tasks that have
              nothing to do with the quality of their relationships or the strength of their candidacy.
              Researching companies before interviews. Manually tracking where each conversation stands.
              Preparing the night before because there was no structured prep process. Waiting for roles
              to appear on job boards that were filled through informal networks three weeks earlier.
            </p>
            <p>
              The result: they arrive at your sessions with uneven preparation and you spend session
              time reconstructing context instead of doing strategy work.
            </p>
            <p>
              Starting Monday handles the infrastructure. You handle the human work.

            <p>
              Starting Monday does not provide the strategic judgment, the relationship capital, or the
              human calibration that executive coaching provides. It does not know when your client
              is self-sabotaging in interviews. It does not know that they are underselling a specific
              achievement. It does not have the relationship with the search firm partner that you may
              have spent years building.
            </p>
            <p>
              It handles the research, the tracking, and the rhythm. You handle everything else.

              The simplest way to start: recommend Starting Monday to your next client entering
              transition and ask them to share view access to their pipeline with you. Within one
              week you will have a clear picture of their search activity that would have taken three
              sessions to reconstruct verbally.
