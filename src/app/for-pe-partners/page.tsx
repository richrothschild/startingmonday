    forFirm: 'Your portfolio company needs a new CIO. The mandate goes to a search firm. The firm assembles a long list. Six weeks pass before you see candidates. Starting Monday inverts that sequence. Executives who are already monitoring your portfolio companies - watching for leadership changes, funding activity, technology team signals - are positioned before the mandate is even formalized.',
    outcome: 'The right candidates reach out before the search goes to a firm. That is a shorter timeline, a warmer candidate, and a relationship that started before the formal process. That matters to a value creation schedule.',

    name: 'Candidate Preparation for Your Mandates',
    forFirm: 'When you are evaluating technology executive candidates for a portfolio company, the quality of their preparation signals the quality of their judgment. A candidate who walks in with a clear analysis of the company situation, a specific thesis for the technology function, and informed questions about the operating environment is a different category of candidate. Starting Monday gives executives the platform to build that preparation.',
    outcome: 'The candidates you see are prepared at depth. The first conversation moves faster. Less time explaining the company situation, more time evaluating fit.',

    name: 'Pipeline Visibility for Operating Partners',
    forFirm: 'If you are working with executives who are candidates for multiple portfolio company roles simultaneously, pipeline view access gives you a clear picture of where each candidate\'s attention is, which conversations are active, and where timing may create conflicts. It is the same view the executive has - without requiring a status call.',
    outcome: 'You stay current on candidate activity without additional touchpoints. Scheduling decisions and timing conversations become more informed.',

    forFirm: 'Before any candidate interviews at a portfolio company, the platform generates a full prep brief: company situation from public signals, the operating challenges the technology function likely faces, the questions that demonstrate operational seriousness, and the narrative the candidate should lead with. The brief is assembled from public signals, not from anything proprietary.',
    outcome: 'Candidates arrive at portfolio company interviews with genuine operational depth. That is a better signal for the hiring committee and a faster path to conviction.',

              <p>
                Starting Monday is an AI-powered search platform built for VP and C-suite technology
                executives in active career transition. It gives them the intelligence infrastructure
                that senior searches require: monitoring of target companies for pre-search signals,
                AI-generated prep briefs for every interview, structured pipeline tracking, and a
                daily briefing that keeps the search moving.
              </p>
              <p>
                For PE operating partners, the platform serves a specific function: it puts prepared,
                informed technology executive candidates in front of the right opportunities faster -
                including at your portfolio companies, before and during formal search mandates.
              </p>

            <section id="timeline-problem" className="space-y-4 text-[15px] text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
              <h2 className="text-[22px] font-bold text-slate-900">The timeline problem</h2>
              <p>
                A portfolio company technology leadership gap has a direct cost. Every week without
                a CIO or VP of Technology in place is a week the value creation plan slips. The
                retained search process is thorough, but it is slow. Six to twelve weeks from mandate
                to offer is typical. First-round failures extend that.
              </p>
              <p>
                The most common cause of first-round failure at the senior level is not fit - it is
                preparation. A candidate who did not understand the company situation. A candidate
                who had not thought through the technology operating model. A candidate who answered
                questions like a job seeker instead of a peer.
              </p>
              <p>
                Starting Monday does not replace the search firm. It gives the executive the
                preparation infrastructure to show up as the right person when the moment comes.

                PE operating partners typically maintain relationships with 20 to 50 senior technology
                executives who may be candidates for portfolio company roles over time. Starting Monday
                gives you something concrete to offer those relationships between mandates: a platform
