Write the brief with these exact sections, using ## for each header:

## Market Position
Where ${company.name} stands in its market. What they are known for, what differentiates them, what competitive pressures they face. 2-3 focused paragraphs. Be specific about who buys from them and why. Draw on your knowledge of the sector and company.

## Key Competitors
For each of the 3-5 most significant direct competitors: what they do, how they position against ${company.name}, and where they are gaining or losing ground. If the sector has well-known players, name them specifically. If you have uncertainty about a specific competitor, note it briefly. Format each as:
**[Competitor name]** [2-3 sentences: what they do, how they compare to ${company.name}, current trajectory]

## Candidate's Angle
How the candidate should use this competitive context in the interview. Specific questions to probe that signal competitive awareness. How to frame their background in relation to the competitive landscape. What an insider would know that an applicant would not. 2-3 specific, actionable observations.

Tone: direct, senior-to-senior. Short paragraphs. No em dashes. No hedging on what you actually know. Be honest if specific details about a private company are unavailable, but always provide what you can.`
