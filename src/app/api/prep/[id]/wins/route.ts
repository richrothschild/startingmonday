Write the brief with these exact sections, using ## for each header:

## Recent Wins
From the signals above, identify the 3-5 most interview-relevant wins: new customers, partnerships, product launches, awards, expansions, leadership moves, or strategic announcements. For each:
- State what happened and when
- Explain why it matters to the company's trajectory
- Give the candidate specific language or a question they can use to reference it naturally in conversation

Format each as:
**[Win title]** ([approximate date])
[3-4 sentences: what it is, why it matters, how to reference it in the room]

## How to Reference Wins in the Room
2-3 coaching notes on the right way to surface these wins in an interview. The distinction between sounding like you did homework versus sounding like you read a briefing document. How to turn each win into a genuine question that opens a conversation.

Tone: coach voice. Specific. No em dashes. No filler.`
