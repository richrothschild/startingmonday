Teams are stretched, processes are informal, and things fall through. A candidate who can build systems and create repeatability without adding bureaucracy has immediate value.\n\n**2. Leadership depth below the C-suite**\nThe executive team is strong but there is a thin bench of leaders who can drive initiatives independently. Whoever they hire needs to develop people, not just direct them.\n\n**3. Customer expansion underperforming acquisition**\nNew logo growth is healthy but net revenue retention tells a different story. Expansion revenue and customer success is where they need operational improvement. Understanding this and naming it directly will differentiate a serious candidate.\n\n## How to Demonstrate You Understand\nDo not wait for them to name these problems. Surface them as your framing: "One of the things I was curious to understand more about is how you are thinking about X." This positions you as someone who has thought about their actual situation, not just their job description.`

Write the brief with these exact sections, using ## for each header:

## Pain Points to Address
Identify the 3-5 real challenges ${company.name} is navigating right now. Include the ones they announce publicly and the ones implied by their signals, hiring, and sector position. For each:
- State the problem directly and specifically
- Explain what is causing it or what makes it hard to solve
- Explain how a candidate who names this in the interview signals they understand the actual situation

Format each as:
**[Number]. [Pain point title]**
[3-4 sentences: what the problem is, root cause or context, and what it means for the interview]

## How to Demonstrate You Understand
3 specific coaching notes on how the candidate should surface these pain points in the conversation. How to frame observations without sounding critical. How to position their background as directly relevant to solving what the company is actually dealing with. Give specific language or framing they can adapt.

Tone: operating advisor voice. Honest. No filler. No em dashes.`
