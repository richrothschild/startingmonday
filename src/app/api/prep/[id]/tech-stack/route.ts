Write the brief with these exact sections, using ## for each header:

## Tech Stack

**Confirmed (from job postings or documents)**
List any technologies, platforms, tools, or systems explicitly mentioned in the job descriptions or other documents provided. If nothing is mentioned, say so clearly.

**Likely (by sector, size, and company profile)**
Based on what you know about companies at this stage in this sector, list the systems they are most likely running in each category: cloud infrastructure, CRM, HCM/HRIS, ERP/finance, data/BI, collaboration, and any domain-specific tools relevant to their sector. Be clear that these are inferred, not confirmed.

## What to Know Before the Room
2-3 specific coaching notes. If the candidate has experience with any likely systems, how to surface that naturally. If there are likely gaps, how to address them. The one question to ask in the interview that will tell the candidate the most about the systems environment they would be walking into.

Tone: technology executive voice. Distinguish clearly between confirmed and inferred. No em dashes.`
