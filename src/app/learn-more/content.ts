    question: 'Is my search visible to employers?',

  },
  {
    question: 'What if I already have LinkedIn Premium, a CRM, and a coach?',

    citations: [3, 5],
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need a large network for this to work?',
    answer: 'No. The goal is to identify the right paths, not the largest number of contacts. Precision matters more than visible reach in executive transitions.',
    citations: [5, 8],
  },
  {
    question: 'Can this help if I am early in my search and not ready to reach out yet?',

    citations: [3, 6],
  },
  {
    question: 'How is this different from generic AI career tools?',

  },
  {
    question: 'Will this still matter once I have active interviews?',

  {
    question: 'What exactly is in a brief?',
    answer: 'A good brief includes role context, likely objections, questions to ask, and the positioning angle that should open the conversation.',
    citations: [1, 4],
  },
  {
    question: 'Who is this best for?',
    answer: 'It is best for private leadership transitions where relationship paths and timing matter more than public application volume.',
    citations: [3, 6],
  },
  {
    question: 'Does this replace my coach, recruiter, or CRM?',
    answer: 'No. It supports the operating work around them so each of those relationships can be more effective.',
    citations: [4, 8],
  },
  {
    question: 'Why does the product focus so much on behavior?',
    answer: 'Because intention is cheap and consistency is rare. Executive transitions improve when the right actions keep happening between high-stakes moments.',
    citations: [4, 5, 8],
  },
  {
    question: 'What kinds of signals are most valuable?',
    answer: 'Signals that suggest a role is changing, a leader is leaving, budget is moving, or a new executive capability is needed.',
    citations: [3, 7],
  },
  {
    question: 'How many target companies should I watch?',
    answer: 'Enough to create real option value, but not so many that you dilute attention and relationship quality.',
    citations: [5, 8],
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I use it if I am currently employed and need confidentiality?',
    answer: 'Yes. The product is specifically designed for low-visibility transitions and private search behavior.',
    citations: [4, 6],
  },
  {
    question: 'What is relationship momentum?',
    answer: 'It is the rate at which the right conversations move forward because context, timing, and follow-through are handled well.',
    citations: [2, 5, 8],
  },
  {
    question: 'Does it help after the role is posted?',
    answer: 'Yes, but the edge is strongest before the market gets crowded because that is when timing and targeted relationships matter most.',
    citations: [3, 7],
  },
  {
    question: 'How is the narrative system different from resume tuning?',
    answer: 'It is built for decision-makers and role context, not just for applicant-document polish.',
    citations: [4, 5],
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I collaborate with a coach or advisor?',
    answer: 'Yes. The model is designed so trusted collaborators can work from the same context instead of rebuilding it every session.',
    citations: [4, 8],
  },
  {
    question: 'What does the pattern-recognition engine actually do?',
    answer: 'It highlights combinations of movement that change search probability, so the user acts on patterns rather than isolated noise.',
    citations: [3, 7],
  },
  {
    question: 'Is this mainly for technology executives?',
    answer: 'The current public narrative is strongest there, but the underlying operating logic is about senior transitions more broadly.',
    citations: [4, 6],
  },
  {
    question: 'How should I think about ROI?',
    answer: 'ROI comes from better timing, sharper preparation, and fewer stalled relationship threads during a high-value transition.',
    citations: [1, 2, 3],
  },
  {
    question: 'What if I only need interview prep?',
    answer: 'The platform can help there, but it is strongest when prep is connected to signal, narrative, and relationship context.',
    citations: [1, 4],
  },
  {
    question: 'What if my market moves slowly?',
    answer: 'Slow markets still reward preparation and early context because they create fewer but more consequential moments to act.',
    citations: [5, 6],
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I know what to do each week?',
    answer: 'The system is designed to reduce the week to a small set of decisive actions rather than an unbounded task list.',
    citations: [2, 5, 8],
  },
  {
    question: 'Why do you publish source notes publicly?',
    answer: 'Because premium trust depends on showing how claims were formed, where they came from, and what confidence level they deserve.',
    citations: [1, 2],
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens if my search direction changes?',
    answer: 'That is expected. The value of the system is that it helps the user re-evaluate targets, narrative, and relationships without losing context.',
    citations: [4, 6, 8],
