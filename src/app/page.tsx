const FAQS: FAQ[] = [

    question: 'I already have a strong network. How does this add value?',
    answer: 'Most strong networks are reactive: you know who to call when you need something. Starting Monday makes them proactive: you know when to call, what to say, and which relationships to prioritize before the market moves. Your network is an asset. This makes it strategic.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is this really different from doing this myself?',
    answer: 'The pieces exist: LinkedIn, company research, conversation prep. What differs is timing and discipline. Starting Monday surfaces opportunities before they are public, flags which relationships matter most, and structures execution so you don\'t lose momentum between conversations. You move earlier. You move with more certainty.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is my search completely private?',
    answer: 'Completely. No employer visibility, no recruiter access to your data, no sale of information. We do not monetize your search. You own everything you enter, and you can delete your entire account whenever you choose.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Will this add to my workload?',
    answer: 'No. A daily three-minute brief and one weekly update. That\'s it. The system is built around leaders already in motion. It reduces cognitive load by centralizing signal, timing, and execution tracking in one place.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What does it cost?',
    answer: 'Forty-nine dollars monthly, or free for your first thirty days. No credit card required, cancel anytime. Designed to fit the search window, not to lock you into long contracts.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I know I can trust this?',
    answer: 'The platform was built by search leaders who ran their own campaigns against the same constraints you face. It\'s grounded in research with leaders at Fortune 500, private equity, and venture firms. Read the evidence hub to see the research backing the approach.',
