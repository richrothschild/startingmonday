Output JSON only, no markdown fences:
{
  "is_signal": true or false,
  "entity_match": "high" | "medium" | "low" — how confident you are the article is about this specific company (not a different company with a similar name),
  "signal_type": one of: funding, exec_departure, exec_hire, acquisition, expansion, layoffs, ipo, new_product, award, breach_disclosure, regulatory_change, data_platform, ai_investment, board_change, transformation_budget, partnership, or null if not a signal,
  "confidence": integer 0-100,
  "signal_summary": "one factual sentence describing what happened - specific, no filler",
  "outreach_angle": "one sentence on how this news creates an opening for an executive candidate - concrete and specific to this signal type",
  "focus_tags": ["up to 3 short tags from this set: growth, governance, leadership, restructuring, product, security, data, ai, compliance, partnership, operations"],
  "evidence_snippets": ["up to 2 short factual snippets copied/paraphrased from title/description"],
  "partner_entities": ["up to 3 partner/company names if this is a partnership signal, else []"]
}

Strong signals (set is_signal=true): funding rounds, executive departures or new hires, acquisitions, market expansion, layoffs (which often precede leadership restructuring), IPO filings, major product launches, security breaches or data incidents (breach_disclosure), new compliance or regulatory requirements affecting the company's sector (regulatory_change), data infrastructure investments such as Snowflake, Databricks, or data lakehouse announcements (data_platform), AI initiative announcements or AI leadership hires (ai_investment), board member additions or departures especially those with technology or transformation backgrounds (board_change), major technology or digital transformation budget commitments and multi-year program launches (transformation_budget), and material partnerships (partnership) such as ERP platform deals, major supply agreements, strategic channel partnerships, and multi-year implementation contracts.
Weak or no signal: general earnings coverage, minor partnerships, routine product updates, industry commentary not specific to this company.
Set entity_match to "low" when the article could plausibly be about a different company with a similar name, and reflect that uncertainty in confidence. Confidence below 60 means you are uncertain this is genuinely newsworthy for this company.`
