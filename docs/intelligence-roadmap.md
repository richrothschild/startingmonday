## First Principles

1. **Collect at the most granular level possible.** You can aggregate up. You can never disaggregate down. Every field skipped at collection time is a model feature permanently lost.
2. **Collect over the longest time horizon possible.** Historical data is the training set. The current signal is only valuable when you know what patterns preceded it.
3. **Public data is an underexploited moat.** EDGAR, GDELT, Wikidata, ProPublica, OpenCorporates, USASpending — these are free, lawful, and systematically ignored by most competitors. The moat is not access to data; it is the synthesis layer built on top of it over time.
4. **The departure event is not the signal. The departure event is the confirmation.** The signal is the 30-180 days of context before the departure that, in hindsight, pointed to it. The model learns to recognize that context in real time.
5. **The database improves with age and scale.** Every new departure-to-appointment pair added to the training set makes the lag model more accurate. Every new user adds relationship graph edges. This is a compound moat — it cannot be copied on day one.

## Intelligence Vision

Starting Monday becomes the definitive predictive intelligence platform for senior technology executive transitions. The platform knows — with calibrated probability — when a company is approaching a technology leadership search, how long that search will take, and who in the user's network has a warm path in, before any search firm is engaged and before any role is posted.

The output is not a data feed. It is a ranked, personalized, time-sensitive action list: these companies, in this order, for this reason, with this outreach approach, in this window.

### Gaps in Current Implementation

| Gap | Impact | Priority |
|-----|--------|----------|
| CIK not stored in `companies` table | Re-runs fuzzy name match on every scan; mismatch risk | High |
| DEF 14A (proxy statements) not fetched | Missing board composition change signals | High |
| 13-D / 13-G filings not monitored | Missing activist investor early warning | High |
| Form 4 insider transactions not monitored | Missing exec share-sale pre-departure signals | Medium |
| PredictLeads not integrated | Missing job-posting-based exec change signals | High |
| Revelio Labs not integrated | Missing org-structure inference signals | Low (deferred) |
| No historical training dataset | Pattern fingerprinting lacks labeled data | Critical for Phase 3 |
| No executive history database | Tenure model, lag model cannot be built | Critical for Phase 3 |

- Provides: headcount by function and seniority, attrition rates, org restructuring signals
- Differentiation from PDL: org-level signals vs. individual-level
- Verdict: Additive but not critical given PDL + PredictLeads. Revisit at 10,000+ users.

**Boardex (Dow Jones/Factiva)**
- Premier executive and board relationship database; 2M+ executive career histories
- Backbone for the executive relationship graph (list item #1)
- Very expensive; evaluate licensing cost vs. build cost of own database
- Build path: Proof of concept after in-house executive history database reaches 50,000+ records

## E1 — EDGAR Foundation + PredictLeads
**Sprint B target. Highest immediate impact.**

### Stories

**E1.1 — Persist SEC CIK in companies table**
- Migration: add `sec_cik`, `sec_cik_padded`, `sec_cik_resolved_at`, `is_public_company` to `companies`
- Modify `findCik()` in `fetch-sec-filings.js`: on first successful resolution, write CIK back to `companies` table
- On subsequent scans: read stored CIK directly, skip fuzzy name search
- If CIK not found: mark `is_public_company = false`, skip EDGAR for this company
- Acceptance: zero repeated CIK lookups for companies scanned more than once

**E1.2 — EDGAR DEF 14A board composition parser**
- New file: `worker/signals/fetch-sec-proxy.js`
- On each scheduled scan: for public companies (has CIK), check if a DEF 14A was filed in the past 14 months
- Fetch DEF 14A primary document; extract director table (names, committees, tenure years)
- Upsert into `board_snapshots` table
- Compare against prior year snapshot; detect: new director, director departure, committee chair change
- Write detected changes to `board_changes` and generate a signal if a technology committee change is detected
- Acceptance: board composition change generates a `board_change` signal type in `company_signals`

**E1.3 — EDGAR 13-D activist investor watcher**
- New file: `worker/signals/fetch-sec-activist.js`
- Maintain a hardcoded watchlist of known activist investors with historical management-change pattern
  - Elliott Management, Starboard Value, Third Point, Icahn, ValueAct, Jana Partners, Engine Capital
- On each scheduled scan: query EDGAR for 13-D filings by these investors for any company in user watchlists
- If match: generate signal type `activist_entry`; include investor's historical pattern in summary

- Map hiring signals to `hiring_surge` signal type (company hiring aggressively in tech roles)
- Deduplication: skip if same exec name + company + date already exists from PDL diff
- Wire into `signal-job.js` alongside PDL
- Add `PREDICTLEADS_API_KEY` to env config and Railway secrets

## Success Metrics

### Intelligence Quality
- Signal precision: % of `pattern_alert` signals that are followed by a confirmed search (90-day window)
- Signal lead time: avg days before a search is posted publicly for detected patterns
- False positive rate: % of `pattern_alert` signals with no subsequent search activity

### Database Coverage
- Executive positions in database: target 100,000 by end of Phase 2; 500,000 by end of Phase 4
- Departure-appointment pairs with computed lag: target 5,000 by end of E3; 25,000 by Phase 4
- Company tenure stats: target 2,000 companies with sufficient sample size (n >= 3)

### User Impact
- Signal-to-action rate: % of signals where user takes an action (log outreach, update contact)
- Pattern alert outreach conversion: % of pattern alert outreach drafts that are sent by user
- "First to know" rate: % of searches where user was alerted before the role was posted publicly

## Open Questions

1. **PredictLeads vs. PDL overlap**: After integrating both, measure what % of executive change signals are unique to each source vs. duplicated. If PDL already catches 90% of what PredictLeads finds, reassess cost.
2. **EDGAR 5.02 parsing accuracy**: 8-K Item 5.02 filings vary widely in structure. Build a parsing accuracy benchmark using 100 manually verified filings before scaling the backfill.
3. **PDL enrichment cost**: Run a sample of 500 EDGAR-extracted executive names through PDL enrichment before committing to the full backfill. Verify match rate and cost.
4. **Revelio Labs evaluation**: When user base exceeds 5,000, evaluate Revelio for org-structure signals as a complement to PDL roster snapshots.
5. **Boardex licensing**: When in-house executive database reaches 50,000 records, evaluate Boardex for relationship graph enrichment vs. organic growth via user-added contacts.
