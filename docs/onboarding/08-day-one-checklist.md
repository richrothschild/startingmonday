# Day One Checklist

Use this on your first day. Work through every section. Log anything that is broken, confusing, or wrong as a GitHub issue using the format at the bottom of this doc.

The goal is a complete picture of product state: what works, what doesn't, and what needs to be fixed first.

## How to Log a Bug

Create a GitHub issue in `richrothschild/startingmonday` using this format:

```
Title: [Bug] Short description of what is broken

**What I did:**
1. Step 1
2. Step 2
3. Step 3

**What I expected:**
The thing that should have happened.

**What happened instead:**
The actual result. Include the error message or screenshot.

**Environment:**
- Browser: Chrome 125 / Safari 17 / Firefox 126
- Device: Desktop / Mobile (iPhone 15)
- URL: localhost:3000/dashboard/signals

**Screenshot:**
[attach if relevant]

**Priority:**
P1 = user can't complete the task / data at risk
P2 = feature is broken but there is a workaround
P3 = minor visual issue or edge case
```

---

## How to Log a UX / Quality Issue

Not everything is a bug. Some issues are "this works but it's confusing" or "this copy doesn't sound right." Log those too — separately from bugs.

```
Title: [UX] Short description of the friction

**Where it happens:**
URL and user flow context.

**What the current experience is:**
What the user sees or reads.

**Why it's a problem:**
What a senior executive would think when they hit this.

**Suggestion (optional):**
What would be better.
```

## End of Day 1

At the end of your first day, send Rich:

1. A count of bugs filed (P1, P2, P3)
2. A count of UX issues filed
3. The one thing that surprised you most — either worse than expected or better than expected
4. Any access or environment issues that slowed you down

That summary drives the week's bug fix priority.
