# Codebase Guide

How the code is organized and the patterns you must follow.

## The Two Supabase Clients

This is the most important rule in the codebase. Get it wrong and you either have a security bug or broken auth.

**Server client** — use this in every user-facing API route:

```typescript
import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server'
const supabase = await createClient()
```

Uses cookies, respects Row Level Security, scoped to the authenticated user.

**Admin client** — use this only in webhook handlers and background jobs:

```typescript
import { createClient as createSupabaseClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'
function createAdminClient() {
  return createSupabaseClient(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
    process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY!,
  )
}
```

Bypasses RLS entirely. Never use in user-facing routes.

See `src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` for the canonical admin pattern.

---

## Auth Enforcement

Every file in `src/app/api/` except `src/app/api/webhooks/` must call `requireAuth` at the top of its handler:

```typescript
import { requireAuth } from '@/lib/require-auth'

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const user = await requireAuth(request)
  // user.id is the authenticated user's Supabase UUID
  // ...
}
```

Run `npm run check:auth` to verify all routes are covered. The pre-commit hook does not check this automatically, so run it manually when adding routes.

---

## API Route Pattern

```typescript
import { requireAuth } from '@/lib/require-auth'
import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server'
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const user = await requireAuth(request)
  const supabase = await createClient()
  const body = await request.json()

  // validate body (Zod schemas in lib/schemas.ts)
  // business logic
  // return NextResponse.json(result)
}
```

Errors: return `NextResponse.json({ error: 'message' }, { status: 400 })`.

---

## AI Calls

All Claude calls go through `@anthropic-ai/sdk`. Prompts live in `src/lib/prompts.ts`. Models:

- `claude-opus-4-7` — Search Strategy Brief and Executive tier prep briefs (expensive, slow)
- `claude-sonnet-4-6` — Prep briefs (non-executive), resume tailoring, outreach, chat (default)
- `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` — Classification, short tasks (fast, cheap)

Streaming responses: use `createStreamableText()` from `ai` and return a `StreamingTextResponse`. See `src/app/api/briefing/route.ts` for the canonical streaming pattern.

Rate limiting: `src/lib/ai-limits.ts` and `src/lib/burst-limit.ts` handle per-user limits. Always apply limits to AI routes.

---

## Subscription / Feature Access

Gate features by plan tier:

```typescript
import { requireFeatureAccess } from '@/lib/require-feature-access'
await requireFeatureAccess(user, 'prep_brief')  // throws if user can't access
```

Feature to plan mapping is in `src/lib/plans.ts`. When adding a new feature, add it here first.

---

## Database Migrations

New columns or tables go in a new migration file:

```bash
# create migration
supabase migration new my-feature-name

# apply locally (if running local Supabase)
supabase db push

# for production: apply via the Supabase SQL Editor or supabase db push --linked
```

Every table that holds user data must have RLS policies. See existing migrations for the pattern. Always add `user_id uuid references auth.users not null` with an RLS policy `user_id = auth.uid()`.

---

## Component Patterns

Components are in `src/components/`. Most are server-compatible (no `'use client'`). Client components must have `'use client'` at the top.

Styling is Tailwind CSS only — no CSS modules, no styled-components. Font sizes in custom pixel values (`text-[13px]`), not Tailwind named scale (`text-sm`).

No component library (no shadcn, no Radix). Build from primitives. This keeps bundle size down and gives full control over accessibility.

---

## Blog Posts

Each blog post is a page under `src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`. The metadata (title, description, date, keywords) lives in `src/lib/blog-posts.ts` in the `BLOG_POSTS` array. The `BlogPost` layout component handles nav, header, CTA, and footer.

To add a post:

1. Add an entry to `BLOG_POSTS` in `src/lib/blog-posts.ts` (no em dashes in strings)
2. Create `src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` using the `BlogPost` component

---

## Pre-Commit Hook

Lives in `.githooks/pre-commit`. Runs two checks:

1. `tsc --noEmit` — TypeScript must compile with zero errors
2. Em dash grep — no literal `--` character in source files; use `&mdash;` in JSX or reword

If either fails, the commit is blocked. Fix the issue before re-committing. Never bypass with `--no-verify`.

---

## Worker

The `worker/` directory is a separate Node.js service. It runs scheduled jobs (cron-based) and one triggered job (immediate scan on company add). It communicates with the web app via an internal HTTP endpoint secured with `WORKER_SECRET`.

Key files:

- `worker/index.js` — entry point, all cron definitions, job runner with timeout enforcement
- `worker/jobs/` — individual job implementations (21 jobs as of May 2026)
- `worker/signals/` — individual signal fetchers (news, SEC, PDL, Crunchbase, PredictLeads, etc.)
- `worker/scanner/` — Browserless career page scraper
- `worker/briefing/` — daily briefing assembly and delivery
- `worker/lib/` — shared utilities (logger, Supabase client, email helpers)

**Active scheduled jobs (from `worker/index.js`):**

| Job | Schedule (UTC) | What It Does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `scan-job` | Mon/Wed/Fri 08:00 | Career page scan for all users |
| `executive-scan-job` | Tue/Thu/Sat/Sun 08:00 | Career page scan for Executive tier only |
| `executive-evening-scan` | Daily 20:00 | Second career page scan for Executive tier |
| `signal-job` | Mon/Wed/Fri 08:30 | Company intelligence signals (news, SEC, PDL, etc.) |
| `briefing-job` | Every 5 min | Checks per-user timezone/time; sends daily briefing when due |
| `followup-job` | Daily 06:00 | Follow-up reminder emails |
| `momentum-job` | Sunday 23:00 | Pipeline momentum score calculation |
| `momentum-nudge-job` | Daily 10:00 | Emails users when momentum score drops 15+ points |
| `market-digest-job` | Sunday 22:30 | Market intel digest for Monitor/passive tier users |
| `weekly-report-job` | Sunday 23:30 | Weekly progress report |
| `usage-monitor-job` | Daily 09:00 | Checks all services against plan limits |
| `trial-reminder-job` | Daily 10:00 | T-3 and T-0 trial expiry emails |
| `offer-email-job` | Daily 11:00 | Post-offer-acceptance email within 24h |
| `reactivation-job` | Daily 11:30 | One-year anniversary reactivation nudge |
| `activation-reminder-job` | Daily 10:30 | Day-3 and day-7 onboarding nudges |
| `cleanup-job` | Sunday 02:00 | Delete signals older than 90d, stale conversations older than 180d |
| `pulse-job` | Daily 07:00 | Executive tier search health summary |
| `industry-pulse-job` | Sunday 06:00 | Sector-level exec movement digest |
| `opportunity-radar-job` | Sunday 06:30 | Proactive company suggestions per user |
| `concierge-prep-job` | Daily 07:30 | Meeting agendas for calls in next 24h |
| `briefing-watchdog-job` | Daily 14:00 | Alerts Rich if no briefings sent in 36h |

When adding a new scheduled job, add it to `worker/index.js` and update `docs/architecture.md`.
